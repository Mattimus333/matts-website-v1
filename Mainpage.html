      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi I'm Matt, welcome to my ok website.  Let's get the basic information out of the way first.
        I'm 28 and live in Berkeley, CA.  I grew up in a nearby city and lived in the Bay Area most of my life!
        the places I've called home are Richmond, Berkeley, El Cerrito, San Francisco, Tacoma(WA), and
        Denver(CO).  If I ever relocate from the Bay Area I'd strongly consider going back up to the Northwest
        somewhere.  Throughout the rest of this home page you will learn a bit about my hobbies, interests, and
        education.

      <h2> Hobbies </h2>
      <p>I enjoy spending a lot of my free time outdoors. I'm often found hiking, climbing, snowboarding and snowshoing.
        During the summer I'm often out backpacking in the Sierras.  My favorite trailhead is the Kennedy Meadows Trailhead in the Emigrant
        Wilderness.  You can find a link to a wonderful USFS wilderness map pdf
        <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5403398.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>

        I also like to read; mostly history and fiction.  Recently I've been nerding out really hard on Roman history,
        particularly the period of the late Republic.  To anyone interested in an introduction to the subject I recommend
        you read <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91017.Rubicon">Rubicon, by Tom Holland</a>.  If you dig around
        the internet a bit you can also find translations of the writings of Julius Ceasar for free.  Pretty neat!

      <h2> Education </h2>
      <p>
        I graduated El Cerrito Highschool class of 2006.  I decided I wanted to get far away(but stay on the west coast)
        for college and decided to go to school at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA.  After taking my sweet
        time figuring out a major I decided to go with philosophy!  My primary interest was moral philosophy but I also
        studied a lot of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language.  In my last semester of college I took a Java course to finish
        up a math minor, that is how I became interested in programming!  I am excited to continue my journey with Galvanize!
